# 🛍 Real-Time E-Commerce Analytics with BigQuery, Python & Looker Studio

A cloud-based analytics project that monitors and visualizes real-time e-commerce performance using Google BigQuery, Python, and Looker Studio.  
It demonstrates how data can be streamed, stored, and visualized instantly to drive intelligent business decisions.

---

## 📊 Overview
This project simulates live e-commerce transactions and streams them into Google BigQuery, where data is aggregated and visualized in Looker Studio.  
The dashboard tracks key metrics such as total revenue, sales trends, category performance, and low-stock alerts — all updated in near real time.

## 🧩 How It Works
1. Python (Colab) simulates live order events using the Faker library.  
2. The data is streamed into BigQuery in real time.  
3. BigQuery acts as a cloud data warehouse for analytics and storage.  
4. Looker Studio connects directly to BigQuery to display visual dashboards.  
5. Users can view live KPIs, category breakdowns, and stock-level alerts.
